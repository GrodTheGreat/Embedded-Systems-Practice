### Project 9: Real-time Operating System (RTOS)
**Overview:** Build a weather station that collects data from various sensors and sends it to a cloud platform for visualization.
**Skills:** Sensor fusion for collecting multiple types of data, Low-power optimization for IoT applications, Cloud platform integration (e.g., MQTT, HTTP)
**Languages:** C, C++, Rust

### Project 10: Autonomous Robot
**Overview:** Develop an autonomous robot capable of navigating a predefined environment using sensors and actuators.
**Skills:**  Sensor fusion for environment perception (e.g., ultrasonic, IR sensors), Control algorithms for navigation (e.g., PID control), Integration of motors and motor drivers
**Languages:** C, C++, Rust

For each project, start by understanding the basic requirements and break them down into smaller tasks. Google and online forums like Stack Overflow and Reddit are great resources for troubleshooting and learning. Additionally, consider using development boards like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or STM32 for practical implementation.
